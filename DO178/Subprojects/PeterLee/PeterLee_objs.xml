        <s407>HLR_0040 currently doesn't have an ET associated with it.  An LLR below it will have an ET associated that tests the exit application function but since its narrow in scope the ET was applied at the LLR Level.  Please review for correctness.  Also should the HLR_0040 have a TCI that points to the LLR's TCI?  Or should the LLR's TCI verify HLR_0040. Consider the possibility of a traceability graph violation </s407>

        <s2351>The Cell output shall be calculated as the number of lumens demanded per metre multiplied by the cell spacing</s2351>

        <s2201>The LampType class shall default to no output until initialised</s2201>
        <s1626>The Lamptype class must be instantiated with the sequences prior to the invocation of GetPowerRequired</s1626>
        <s2213>The MountArea class shall be initialised with the ceiling area available for mounting lamps specified by the length and breadth</s2213>

        <s2311>The Tunnel Lighting system shall be configurable via an external file and take into account tunnel dimensions, zones, spacing for signs ,and efficiency factor</s2311>
        <s2299>The Tunnel Lighting system shall manage output calculation in tiers so that lamps, cells, zones, and the tunnel can be controlled with the necessary granularity</s2299>
        <s2360>The Tunnel Lighting system shall provide an human machine interface for emulation of input and examination of output data</s2360>
        <s2179>The Tunnel lighting system data shall be initialised such that all zones and their data is populated upon start up</s2179>
        <s2331>The Tunnel lighting system shall be controlled by a lighting control unit that will receive inputs from a power supply heath signal and an externally mounted photometer</s2331>
        <s2233>The Tunnel lighting system shall include a single photometer placed at the entrance of the tunnel.  The photometer will measure light intensity and provide this data to the lighting control unit.  Typically, such a meter will employ a light receptor filtered to provide a spectral response close to that of the average human eye. Its reaction to changes in light levels is virtually instantaneous.  The light receptor is used to measure average luminance (brightness) within an acceptance angle subtending 20º over a measurement range of 0-6500 cd/m2</s2233>
        <s2100>The Tunnel lighting system shall include facilities for the handling of emergency exit signs and sirens.   These should include provision to allow the basic configuration of the system itself, in particular:  1. the number of lamps which can be positioned in a particular ceiling section, and 2. the current drain placed on emergency battery provision by each model of lamp, and by the system as a whole</s2100>
        <s1963>The Tunnel lighting system shall measure efficiency of lamps based on the number of days since cleaning the lamps</s1963>
        <s2066>The Tunnel lighting system software shall be initialised by an initialisation file that describes Tunnel width and zone data</s2066>
        <s1399>The Tunnel software output  produced from photometer inputs, given a set of input configuration files, verified against expected output files will verify that data management capabilities of the software are being met
</s1399>
        <s1853>The Tunnel software output  produced from photometer inputs, given a set of input configuration files, will show lamp grouping is determined by configuration inputs.</s1853>
        <s1821>The Tunnel software output  produced from photometer inputs, given a set of input configuration files, will show lamp positioning is determined by configuration inputs on dimensions and zone layout.  The output produced must be compared with expected output data files to verify this calculation is being done correctly</s1821>
        <s1427>The Tunnel software output  produced from photometer inputs, given a set of input configuration files, will show lamps per mounting are being correctly calculated.  Expected output results files will be compared against the produced output
</s1427>
        <s1842>The Tunnel software output from photometer inputs will result in luminaries grouped in sets of one two or three.   Given specific configuration values from set of configuration input files expected output files must me compared to the tunnel software output to verify that luminaries grouping is defined as configured</s1842>
        <s1664>The Tunnel software output produced  for a range of inputs will demonstrate that lamps are turned off when a minimum percentage of maximum output levels are reached
</s1664>
        <s1785>The Tunnel software output produced  for a range of inputs will demonstrate that larger lamps are utilized initially and smaller lamps are added as increased power is needed.    As photometer inputs range from 4-20 mAmps, output data will show larger lamps being turned on in various zones first and then smaller lamps being turned on as needed.  When the range inputs are starting a higher number and decrementing, smaller lamps will turn off as their additional capacity isn't needed.  Actual output to be compared to expected output data file
</s1785>
        <s1591>The Tunnel software output produced for photometer inputs will that days since cleaning and resulting efficiency is being correctly factored in deciding which lamps are to be included and which to be excluded. Multiple expected results files must be compared with actual results based on different efficiency levels
</s1591>
        <s1755>The Tunnel software output produced for the full range of cleanliness factors observable from the results (this is really not testable)
</s1755>
        <s1847>The Tunnel software output produced from photometer inputs shall show straight line calculations each zone</s1847>
        <s1773>The Tunnel software output produced from photometer inputs will show calculations for all lamps.  These must be compared to expected output files to ensure that appropriate output levels commands are being sent
</s1773>
        <s1827>The Tunnel software output produced from photometer inputs will show calculations for all zones</s1827>
        <s1420>The Tunnel software output produced from photometer inputs will show calculations for cell output.  Expected output files will be compared against this output to ensure that cell output is being computed correctly

</s1794>
        <s1542>The Tunnel software output produced to drive maximum lm/W levels will generate output levels no greater than 120 lm/w
</s1542>
        <s1837>The Tunnel software output produced will demonstrate photometer inputs ranging from 4-20 mAmps produce expected outputs determined by comparison with expected output files.  From this 4 mAmps being considered zero luminance and 20 mAmps as 6,500 cd/m2 is to be inferred
</s1837>
        <s1610>The Tunnel software output produced will verify linear calculation of lamp output from 120 lm/W to 60 lm/W
</s1610>
        <s1490>The Tunnel software output when the power failure state is set shall have all lamp output set to the same calculated value.  Given a configuration set of files, the output for power failure must be compared to expected data files
</s1490>
        <s461>The failed Lamp output handling behaviour should actually be implemented and verified at a lower scope.  The recommendation is to either add a requirement that considers the failure case to augment LLR_0160.  A test should consider the testing the failure case of a Powersetting being less than or equal to zero.  This test should also allow for structural coverage of this condition in the TunnelData::Lamp::SendPowerToLamp method.</s461>
        <s2265>The lamptype class shall be initialised with its maximum power consumption as well as the maximum and minimum output percentages</s2265>

        <s2261>The output from each lamp shall specified via a Digital Addressable Ballast (DAB) unit</s2261>
        <s371>The power states are not specified in the requirement text.  They need to be provided or referred to within a table</s371>
        <s467>The requirement HLR_0340 seems to be scoped over data management, storage, and reporting.   The test description is quite generic about how the expected behaviour to be met.  

More specifics regarding variants of initialisation data (ie. Tunnel.ini) and the specifics to be examined in the output data are needed</s467>
        <s506>The requirement mentions that the unit will receive inputs but doesn't state what to do with them .. is this correct?</s506>

        <s492>The term &quot;necessary granularity&quot; needs to be reviewed.  This makes implementation of the algorithm subject to the interpretation of the term &quot;necessary&quot; </s492>
        <s441>The text in this requirement needs to be updated t</s441>
        <s440>The text in this requirement needs to be updated to reflect the max-min &gt; small and the lumens required &gt; minimum lumens as well as the power calculation formula (implement correctly in the source code)</s440>

        <s383>The use of this is unclear.  Please provide specific value details</s383>
        <s2291>The zone class shall assign the cell output in lumen units taking into account the distance of the cell from the beginning of the zone</s2291>

        <s1975>The zone class shall determine the formula coefficients needed to determine the outputs in units of lumens/meter for a specific demand percentage</s1975>
        <s2355>The zone class shall increase the power to the lamps to compensate for lumen output reductions due to lamp soiling</s2355>
        <s2284>The zone class shall set the default intensity to the brightest level for all the lamps in a luminaire.</s2284>

        <s446>These two are file I/O based.  Get .. Read etc. Coverage appears to show that Tunnel.ini wasn't available for reading.   Likely the start in directory needs to be changed</s446>
        <s392>This Human Machine Interface (HMI) requirement is meant for both inputs and output functionality.   The HMI device allows the user to configure the Tunnel lighting system as well as utilize it for simulating external interfaces for testing.</s392>
        <s401>This appears to be a high level or system level requirement</s401>
        <s509>This appears to be multiple requirements and may need to be broken up.  Shall &quot;include facilities&quot; is also ambiguous</s509>
        <s374>This may be considered a compound requirement.  Please review</s374>
        <s503>This requirement appears to be stating that the photometer shall just exist ... &quot;include a single photometer placed at the entrance of the tunnel&quot; .. The remaining text is informative but does provide details on an acceptance angle &quot; within an acceptance angle subtending 20º over a measurement range of 0-6500 cd/m2&quot;.  Perhaps this should be rolled into the actual requirement.  Additionally the requirement states that the system shall &quot;include&quot;.  This language is vague and shouldn't be used in a requirement</s503>
        <s487>This requirement much too high.  This is more of a</s487>
        <s486>This requirement much too high.  This is more of an description of the data base.  This requirement at this scope should really be describing how the database is to be initialised.</s486>
        <s437>This test case description appears to describe only one state change.  The state change occur from nominal operation to power failure state.  Then it verifies that the power failure state is operating as expected.  The transition back to nominal operation isn't documented within this test case.  View input data as well to confirm.  The requirement also appears to require more specifics from visible notes.   Will follow up after the requirement has been modified.</s437>
